      <h2 class="trait">3 Days, 3 Weeks, 3 Months</h2>
      <p class="information">Some people believe that taking any animal home should result in them instantly 'fitting in.'
        This is not true. Animals, like people, need time to adjust to new situations and it can take over 3 months
        before an animal feels truly comfortable in their new surroundings.<br>During the first couple of days,
        it can be normal for animals to not want to be near anyone and to spend the time exploring. They
      </p>
      <h2 class="trait">Diet</h2>
      <p class="information">Some animals may enter rescue having never been fed a proper diet. An example would be 
        Jessie & James; two cockatiels who were relinquished to rescue.<br>When they arrived at their
        foster (which turned into a forever) home, they had rabbit muesli in their bowl. When they were given bird seed
        they didn't have a clue what to do with it to start with. It soon emeerged they had mainly been fed on toast
        and scraps of food rather than having a proper diet. The birds were despondent and lethargic until they
        started eating a proper diet.<br>Different animals can suffer different consequences of poor diet and this will
        be one of the first things that often needs correcting. The rescue center you rescue from will advise you
        every step of the way on this.
      </p>
      <h2 class="trait">Separation Anxiety</h2>
      <p class="information">Many animals who enter rescue suffer with separation anxiety. This is where they struggle with being left alone;
        sometimes for as little as one minute.<br>Separation anxiety can cause an animal to be destructive and noisy;
        they may pant, salivate and/or use the house as a toilet.<br>There are many ways to help a dog which suffers 
        however, they take time and patience; there is no quick fix!
      </p>
      <h2 class="trait">Crate Training</h2>
      <p class="information">There is a lot of speculation that using a crate is cruel. This is <b>NOT</b> true. Many dogs find 
      having a crate relaxing and comforting when they are used correctly. Crates are not a punishment tool 
      but can be an effective way to keep dogs who are destructive safe when you leave the house.<br> Crates should
      have a comfortable bed in there (but not something that can be easily destroyed) and many people also
      cover them to provide an extra level of comfort. The door should be left open when the dog is not in it 
      so they can go in and out as they feel fit; when they are used correctly, many dogs will take themselves
      in there when they want some space. </p>
      <h2 class="trait">New Introductions</h2>
      <p class="information">Any new rescue animal may require time to settle before being introduced to any other pets
        or people outside of their new home. It's natural to want to introduce them quickly however, this is not
        what is best for the animal.<br>Introductions should begin slowly; animals in the same house may require
        some separation to begin with especially if one is inquisitive and the other is not; this is totally fine and
        all part of the process. Small and steady steps that work are better than big steps all at once which often
        see animals returned to rescue centers quickly.
      </p>
      <h2 class="trait">Enjoy</h2>
      <p class="information">Whilst rescue is hard work, it is one of the most rewarding things you can do.
        Enjoy!
