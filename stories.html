            <img src="/assets/images/stories/mischiefafter.jpg" class="story-image-left" alt="black and white husky cross malamute">
            <p class="story-writing">At 4 month old, Mischief was rescued from the pound. He had been 
              a street dog; he was underweight and malnourished. Mischief had 
              served his 7 days in kennels and was due to be put to sleep.
            Luckily, a husky rescue stepped up. <br>Mischief was placed in a foster home 
            where it was soon discovered he had serious infections in all of his organs.
            It was thought he wouldn't survive the night.<br>Thanks to dilligent vets and
            a commited foster family, Mischief made it through and was then adopted by his
            fosterers; they couldn't let him go after all he had been through at such a young age...
            Even though he does very much live up to his name!

          <h1 class="photo-head">Little Dave</h1>
          <img src="/assets/images/stories/littledave.jpg" class="story-image-right" alt="black and white husky cross malamute">
            <p class="story-writing">Little Dave was a pet shop reject. Nobody wanted him because he was small and had a wonky head so he was put up for rescue
              adoption.<br> Dave was adopted by a family who immediately took him to receive 
              vet care. After extensive examinations, which cost hundreds of pounds, it was 
              discovered that he had an ear infection; as it had not been treated, the infection
              had spread to his bones and the left side of his face was paralysed.<br>
              With the correct,on-going vet treatment, Little Dave lived happily for a further 
              6 months. His favourite things were green although he was also partial to
              fingers and clothes as well!

          <h1 class="photo-head">Blue</h1>
            <img src="/assets/images/stories/blue.jpg" class="story-image-left" alt="black and white husky cross malamute">
            <p class="story-writing">Blue was  found abandoned in a field in torrential rain.
              He was stuck in the mud; his fur was filthy, his tail and mane were matted.<br>
              The rescue desperately sought Blue's owners but none came forward; they probably
              knew they would face prosecution for the state he was in.<br>
              After months of hard work, Blue is now clean, healthy and enjoying all the 
              home comforts any horse could possibly want.
