            <img src="/assets/images/stories/mischiefafter.jpg" class="story-image-left" alt="black and white husky cross malamute">
            <p class="story-writing">At 4 months old, Mischief was rescued from the pound. He had been 
              a street dog; he was underweight and malnourished. Mischief had 
              served his 7 days in kennels and was due to be put to sleep.
            Luckily, SHARE husky rescue stepped up. <br>Mischief was placed in a foster home 
            where it was soon discovered he had serious infections in all of his organs.
            It was thought he wouldn't survive the night.<br>Thanks to dilligent vets and
            a commited foster family, Mischief made it through and was then adopted by his
            fosterers; they couldn't let him go after all he had been through at such a young age...
            Even though he does very much live up to his name!

          <img src="/assets/images/stories/littledave.jpg" class="story-image-right" alt="brown guinea pig">
            <p class="information">Little Dave was a pet shop reject. Nobody wanted him because he was small and had a wonky head so he was put up for rescue
              adoption by Furever Loved Small Animal Rescue.<br> Dave was adopted by a family who immediately took him to receive 
              vet care. After extensive examinations, which cost hundreds of pounds, it was 
              discovered that he had an ear infection; as it had not been treated, the infection
              had spread to his bones and the left side of his face was paralysed.<br>
              With the correct,on-going vet treatment, Little Dave has a full life.

            <img src="/assets/images/stories/lily.jpg" class="story-image-left" alt="white husky asleep">
            <p class="story-writing"> Lily entered SHARE rescue at 5 weeks old. Her mum was just a baby herself at
              6 months old and had been bred; she was very poorly due to her age and the puppies were sent to rescue
              to give mum a fighting chance. <br> Lily was a nightmare puppy in every way but her family did not give up.
              When left unsupervised, she howled and destroyed things due to separation anxiety; she was
              crate trained for her own safety. In her puppyhood, Lily ate jam jars (although she did leave the metal lid!), socks,
              cupboards, doors...Anything you can think of.<br>With extensive training, hard work, patience, love (and lots of vet bills)
              her family helped her through her anxiety and she now loves nothing more than stealing
              the sofa!

            <img src="/assets/images/stories/blue.jpg" class="story-image-right" alt="brown and white horse eating hay">
            <p class="information">Blue was found abandoned in a field in torrential rain.
              He was stuck in the mud and the water was rising; his fur was filthy, his tail and mane were matted.<br>
              Furever Loved Small Animal Rescue desperately sought Blue's owners but none came forward; they stepped in and saved Blue's life. 
              With generous donations by volunteers of their time to transport him to spare
              horse equpiment to even letting him stay in their fields, Blue was saved and started his new life.<br>
              After months of hard work, Blue is now clean, healthy and enjoying all the 
              home comforts any horse could possibly want. He hsa gone from being scared of everything
              to loving having his mane plaited and playing in the fields with his horse friends.

            <img src="/assets/images/stories/turkeypup.jpg" class="story-image-left" alt="Dog in Turkey">
            <p class="story-writing"> Homeward Bound is run by a British national who
              is not allowed to work in Turkey and relies on donations from people all around the world
              to support dogs in Turkey. Dogs are generally left on the street, in poor conditions with noone
              to love and care for them, feed them or cuddle them.
              When a dog (many of them puppies) is rescued from the poor
              conditions they live in, they are taken to the rescue centre to get used to being treated well; homes are then
              sought for them.<br>There are many Homeward Bound dogs in the UK who have been
              transported to their forever home by a dedicated team of rescuers and the rescue team need as much
              support as possible to find them homes to give these dogs the best chance possible especially as new
              rules have just been brought in meaning they are not even allowed to ask for donations.
